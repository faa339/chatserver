Notes:
Start the server first with ./server then ./client username 
Client usernames can't be more than 255 characters as a 
general limit. 
Messages shouldn't be longer than MAXLINE+MAXNAME characters in total.
That said, they can be sent without issue (tested with a random string 
of 6000 characters)
There's a limit of 10 clients allowed on the server at once. This 
can easily be changed by editing the macro value, it just seemed 
like a good number at the time. 
Connect & disconnects are logged on the servers window as well as 
sent to clients. 

The client's implementation is mostly the same, main difference 
has to do with how messages are sent. In the previous homework I 
had clients always write username and then message to the partner.
This time I had it write the username once and then only write the
message it was receiving. 
Also removed the nametoAddr function I had before as it wasn't 
necessary for this assignment. It could easily be added if the
server was running anywhere other than localhost. 

Server choices made include leaving management of connect 
and disconnect activities on invidual client threads. I had the idea 
of letting the messager handle it but I decided against it.
